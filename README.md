Recipe Generator – Advanced AI Project

This repository contains all of the Python source code for my Advanced AI project.
It also contains additional files that all collectively have contributed to a finalized project.
The project focuses on fine-tuning and deploying a recipe generation model.

The base model Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and the fine-tuned LoRA adapters are not included in this repository.
These files are several gigabytes in size and exceed GitHub’s storage limits.
Because of this, the repository is code-only. You can fully study and evaluate the scripts, but running them requires access to my exact local model setup, which is not provided here.

Although the models themselves are missing due to size constraints, the repository clearly demonstrates the training pipeline, code structure, and integration into a desktop application.

If hypothetically the models could also be pushed to the repository, a user could easily just pull the repository which contains the app. Then simply open the app and run it, since the built-in virtual environment contains all needed packages etc.
