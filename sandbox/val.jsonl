Preheat the oven to 350*F.\n2. 2. Pour melted butter into a glass 9x13 inch baking dish. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and salt until well blended. Gradually whisk in milk. Pour egg mixture into the baking dish.\n3. 3. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes, then stir, and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes, or until eggs are set. Serve immediately.\n4. My Note: I did modify the recipe slightly buy sauteing some onions and garlic and tossing them in with the batter, and adding cheese when almost done.\n5. They were also incredibly easy to make and a will definitely be a new staple breakfast item whenever I need to serve a crowd. I served them with warmed tortillas and an assortment of sauteed vegetables for people to make their own breakfast burritos. Everyone at my brunch commented on how delicious the eggs were.\n6. Make scrambled eggs perfect every time! We have used this recipe countless times when cooking for a men's breakfast for 60 men. We found some great additions to be chopped green chilies and cream cheese that we cut off the bar with a knife and stir into the egg mixture. The eggs came out moist and fluffy and we have no left overs to show for it! It's also great because you can add any extras you want! **A couple tips though: *If you down scale this recipe; use your judgement for the milk, you may need to add a little less. *Also, if you use a smaller glass dish (ie 9x9) you will have to up your cooking time between 5-10 minute\n7. This time I only made half the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish. Stirred it several times so mine came out more like scrambled eggs but fluffier than scrambled eggs cooked on the stove top.\n8. This makes perfect scrambled eggs, soft and fluffy, but thoroughly cooked, and it is so much easier than standing over the stove making them. I halved the recipe since it is just me and added ham. I love the versatility of this recipe. Next time I will try adding salsa and using slightly less butter. You could also try adding cheese or vegetables.\n9. A very simple scrambled eggs recipe for a large crowd. This dish has become my go-to brunch dish when my family comes over. I usually add the real bacon bits that you can get in a jar and a handful of cheddar cheese if I want to make them extra special. They come out perfect every time. I've even scaled them down to 2 servings for my LOVE ONE and me and they were still delicious.\n"}

Now add the ricotta cheese to the milk and stir to avoid lumps.\n3. After a while the mixture will curdle. Need not worry.\n4. This also has to become thick reducing in quantity. Once it has reduced to half the original quantity add the sugar and melted butter and keep stirring for 3-5 minutes.\n5. The original recipe called for pouring the mixture in a stainless steel plate.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl, stir together 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup almond flour 1/2 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar. Spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off. Using a separate bowl, whisk together the oils, almond milk and almond extract. I find that using a fork gets the job done nicely. Combine the two, until just mixed. The dough will seem a bit moist. Pour the dough into an 11-inch tart pan. I use my hand to gently spread the dough out, and up the sides of the tart pan. Then smooth it with the back side of a meal measuring cup. This makes the tart crust look prettier. Make sure that you have the crust evenly distributed in the pan. We do not want thin, or holes in the tart.\n2. In a bowl, combine 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the vegan butter. Again, using your hands combine together topping ingredients Once your sugar, salt and vegan butter are well incorporated, set the topping aside to add the peaches\n3. I love to bake, but am a bit of a lazy cook. So, sitting and prepping peaches is not where I want to spend my time (unless I have just picked some up at the Saturday farmer's market.) I have found that frozen organic peaches get the job done. No one has noticed the difference, and I am not telling them. So, pour those frozen peaches into the tart shell. I do not even thaw them before using them. Arrange the peaches in a pleasing pattern. I have found that smaller pieces fit into areas needing more peach will look pretty when baked. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until your tart looks golden-brown and all the fruit and juices are bubbly. Cool on a rack.

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: flour, ground, salt, sugar, rosemary, olive oil, water\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Rosemary Cracker Bread\nDirections:\n1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees with a large pizza stone on a rack.\n2. Put flour, flax (if you are using it), salt, sugar and rosemary in a food processor. Pulse to blend. Add oil, pulse 3-4 times. Turn machine to 'on' and add water in stream till dough comes together. Run for about 20 seconds. Turn dough out and knead to a smooth ball. Divide into four pieces and cover with a towel. Let rest for 5 minutes.\n3. Begin with one of the four dough pieces. Using a pasta roller, start on the widest setting and finish on the thinnest, just as you would for rolling pasta dough. It helps to divide the dough one more time about midway through the rolling process, so that one piece of dough results in two long (approximately 4 x 15 strips of rolled dough. I also dust the dough with flour on both sides before rolling at the thinnest setting (which is #7 on my inexpensive manual pasta roller). The two strips get baked at the same time, for a total of four batches of two strips from one cracker bread recipe. I do not begin rolling the second piece of dough until the first batch is cooked. Multitasking for this recipe always results in burned crackers for me!\n4. Spritz dough with water from a spray bottle and sprinkle with sea salt (or kosher) and freshly ground pepper. Slide parchment paper directly into the oven onto the baking stone. Flip crackers over, and move from the front to the back of the oven after about 1 minute. Watch closely. Your oven my vary. You want to flip them after the dough bubbles, but is still pliable. I do this quickly by reaching in with tongs. Watch closely after that. Take them out after no more than a minute-sometimes less. You don't want them browned. There will be light brown spots or speckles and maybe an edge or two will be darkening, but that's it. The strips will still be flexible. You can cut them into 6 lengths at this point with a pizza cutter for uniform sizes, or wait until they are crisp and break them for a more haphazard look.\n5. Cool completely on a rack, then package and store in festive cellophane bags to impress your friends.\n6. If you don't have a pizza stone large enough to bake the strips on, you can use a large cookie sheet. You will need to dramatically increase the cooking time. Watch for the dough to begin to bubble, give it another 30 seconds to a minute and then flip it. You want to take them out when they are beginning to stiffen. So if you grab one out of the oven it will bend into an arc slightly when held in the middle, but won't bend in half.\n7. My directions make it sound much more complicated than it is. I just wanted to be as helpful as I could be, having made many, many batches of these crackers and coming up with helpful tips along the way.\n"}

Separately, combine the water and milk, then whisk in the instant yeast until dissolved.\n4. Add the oil mixture and the water mixture to the dry ingredients.\n5. If using a mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on the lowest speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 4 minutes to form a coarse ball of dough.\n6. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.\n7. Mix for 2 minutes more on medium-low speed or by hand with a spoon, adjusting with flour or water as needed to form a smooth, supple, and tacky but not sticky dough.\n8. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 1 minute, working in more flour or water as needed.\n9. Form the dough into a ball.\n10. Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl large enough to hold the dough when it doubles in size.\n11. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then immediately put it in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 4 days.\n12. (If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.)\n13. Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before you plan to bake and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.\n14. Divide the cold dough into 4-ounce (113 g) pieces for 7-inch rolls or 8-ounce (227 g) pieces for foot-long rolls.\n15. Flatten each piece of dough with your hand, then form it into a 4-inch torpedo shape, or a 7-inch torpedo shape for foot-long rolls, much as you would a batard (see page 21).\n16. Let each piece of dough rest as you move on to the other pieces.\n17. When you return to the first torpedo, gently roll it back and forth to extend it out to about 7 inches, or 13 inches for a foot-long roll.\n18. The roll should have only a very slight taper at the ends.\n19. Place the rolls on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat with about 2 inches between the rolls (it may take 2 pans if you bake the entire batch).\n20. The rolls may shrink back about 1 inch as you pan them.\n21. Mist the tops of the rolls with spray oil, cover loosely with plastic wrap, then let the dough rise at room temperature for about 1 hour.\n22. Remove the plastic wrap from the rolls.\n23. Continue to proof the dough for another 15 minutes, uncovered.\n24. The dough will rise only slightlynot more than 1 1/2 times its original size.\n25. Use a sharp serrated knife or razor blade to cut a slit down the center of each roll, about 1/4 inch deep and about 3 1/2 inches long (or 8 inches for foot-long rolls).\n26. Let the dough proof for 15 minutes after you make the cuts.\n27. Place a steam pan in the oven (a cast-iron frying pan or sheet pan works just fine) and preheat the oven to 425F (218C).\n28. Transfer the rolls to the oven, pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 400F (204C).\n29. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 10 to 20 minutes, until the rolls are a light golden brown and their internal temperature is 190F (88C) in the center.\n30. Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.\n31. Feel free to substitute whole wheat flour or other whole grain flours for some of the bread flour.\n32. If you do so, increase the water by about 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) for every 7 tablespoons (2 oz / 56.5 g) of whole grain flour you substitute.\n"}

Cut the onions in half lengthwise, and then take off the ends, where the last of the peel is probably clinging a bit. Cut each half in half. Slowly, slice the onions. Try to make the slices as even in size as possible.\n2. Set a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat. When the air above the pot feels hot to your touch, pour in the oil. Add the butter. When the butter has melted and the oil shimmers in the pot, add the sliced onions. Toss them to coat with the oil and butter.\n3. After 10 minutes, pinch the sugar (if using) and salt over the top of the onions and stir well to coat. Cook the onions, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until they soften and then begin to reduce in volume. After about 30 minutes, the onions shrink into themselves, browning. Stir the onions, scraping the bottom of the pot with a metal spatula, to catch all that brown caramelized goodness.\n4. Don't let the onions burn! One bit of burn and the entire pot of caramelized onions will taste nasty, furrowing the brow of anyone who eats them. You don't want that.\n5. Turn down the heat to medium. Cook the onions, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot about every 2 to 3 minutes, to make sure they don't burn. If you wish, you can add a tablespoon of water to deglaze the pot and make sure you don't miss any of the browned bits. This is where you have to be attentive.\n6. After 45 minutes, the onions will be lovely. After 60 minutes, the onions will be dark brown, wafting a slight sweetness. The longer you cook them, the darker and sweeter the onions will grow.\n"}

We are tempering our eggs!\n9. The eggs in this dish will help hold our pasta bites together but I cant just add eggs into the hot pasta without them scrambling.\n10. Slowly incorporating the hot pasta water will gradually bring the temperature of the eggs up and will help prevent them from being cooked instantly.)\n11. Now we can stir our tempered eggs into our hot pasta without them scrambling all over the place!\n12. (Pretty cool, huh?)\n13. Next, in a hot skillet fry up pancetta and minced garlic.\n14. Add the crispy pancetta and garlic to the pot of pasta along with a handful of chopped green onions and a heaping handful of grated Parmesan.\n15. Dont forget to season this pasta with a touch of salt and pepper!\n16. Stir all of these ingredients together then twirl a bite of your pasta right out of your pot.\n17. Place that twirled bite into a greased mini muffin pan.\n18. If topping these bites with more Parmesan cheese sounds like a good idea to you, then I think we need to hang out more often because thats a super good idea!\n19. Place your muffin tin in a 350 degrees F oven for 15 minutes.\n20. When your pasta bites come out of the oven, allow them to cool for a bit then place them on a pretty platter!\n21. Enjoy!\n"}

After 15 minutes, remove and cut the frozen buttermilk into chunks the size of ice cubes. Add chunks to the processor and process until the mixture is completely blended and lightened in color. You will need to stop the processor from time to time to scrape the mixture from the side of the bowl or spread and redistribute it to better engage with the processor blades; inspect for lumps of peach when you do this. When the sherbet is smooth and free of lumps, taste and pulse in preserves or additional sugar, to taste, if necessary.\n3. Serve the sherbet immediately or scrape it into a container and store in the freezer until needed. Sherbet will retain its scoopable and spoonable texture for 2 or 3 hours before it hardens. Once it's hard, you will need to soften it for 10 to 20 minutes in the fridge before serving, or zap it for a few seconds at a time in a microwave on defrost.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: bacon, butter, salt, eggs\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Sheet Pan American Breakfast\nDirections:\n1. Heat the oven to 400 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lay the bacon slices evenly across.\n2. Bake the bacon for 10 minutes, until they've given off a good amount of fat but are not yet crisp. While the bacon is baking, grate the potato on the large holes of a grater into a bowl filled with cold water. Swish the potatoes around vigorously, until the water is murky. Drape a kitchen towel (one you don't care much about) into a strainer in the sink. Pour the potatoes into the strainer and let the water run out. Then gather the ends of the towel and twist and squeeze the potatoes into the sink. Do it a few more times until no more liquid comes out.\n3. When the bacon's out of the oven, remove the bacon from the pan and wrap them in a piece of foil to keep warm.\n4. Take one tablespoon of the butter and run it around the parchment on the sheet pan so that the parchment is thoroughly greased (this is a protective measure in case your bacon didn't give off much grease). Now sprinkle the grated potato over the parchment so that they resemble spider webs-not clumps. The thinner the layer of potato, the better they'll crisp up evenly. You want to see the sheet pan beneath the potato. Depending on the size of your potato, you may find you have too much to fit on the baking sheet; don't cramp the potato-you will have less hash browns, but they will be better. Sprinkle lightly with salt and return to the oven for 15 minutes, until the bottoms of the potato snowflakes are golden brown.\n5. Sometime while the potatoes are cooking, heat the other tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Once melted, turn the heat off. (This is you getting ready for a little multitasking in the next step. If your sheet pan can do it, so can you. The best time to do this is about 5 minutes before your potatoes will come out of the oven, but anytime while the potatoes are in the oven will work.)\n6. Take the sheet pan out of the oven and turn the burner under the frying pan to medium-high heat. Using a spatula, carefully flip the potatoes on the sheet pan. The potatoes will have diminished in size, so squish them towards one side of the pan while still making sure they're all in one layer.\n7. Crack your eggs in the melted butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Once the clear egg whites have actually turned white, use your same spatula and transfer the eggs to the free space on the sheet pan. Go get your bacon and lay it wherever it fits (it's okay if there's some overlapping between the bacon and potatoes).\n8. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the potatoes are nice and crispy and the eggs are cooked, about 5 minutes. Eat at once.\n"}

GRANNY TURNER'S HOT ROLLS-1940\n2. Updated by Carol -1990\n3. Updated by Heidi -2007\n4. They seem like a lot of work the first couple times you make them, but they are well worth it! Patience is key. If you have a day at home, definitely make these rolls!\n5. Combine very warm water, sugar, and yeast (sprinkle yeast on top of water and stir lightly). Let sit for 5 minutes.\n6. In a large bowl, combine mashed potatoes (or 1/2 cup hot water and 1/2 cup instant potatoes), salt, oil, and eggs. Mix with a fork until smooth.\n7. Pour yeast mixture over potato mixture and mix with fork or whisk.\n8. Then add flour to the mixture. Knead it until it forms a smooth ball. After kneading it, pour 1/4 cup oil in the bottom of the bowl to keep the dough from sticking. Roll the ball over several times to coat the outside. Cover loosely with plastic wrap sprayed with Pam. Let it rise until doubled.\n9. *If you want to use it the same day, it takes about 2 hours (away from a draft) to rise.\n10. Make into rolls and cover again with sprayed plastic wrap. Let them rise again until doubled before cooking (about 1 hour). I put mine into muffin tins, making 3 rolls, but just rolling them or even making a loaf works too!\n11. Bake at 350F for 10-15 minutes.\n12. *Dough keeps in refrigerator for 2 weeks, but keep it covered. Knead it at least once a day. Add 1/2 c flour or more if sticky.\n13. **For cinnamon rolls, roll out dough onto floured surface. Place sugar, cinnamon, butter and pecans on top, roll up and slice. Top with glaze (powdered sugar and milk) after baked. Bake the same way as rolls.\n14. Occasionally, due to weather, too much flour, or not enough rising time, the rolls end up small and heavier. They still taste good, just not as fluffy and light!\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: whole wheat flour, salt, water, parmesan, cayenne, sesame seeds, cumin\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: High-Tech Crackers\nDirections:\n1. You will need a food processor, several 10 by 14-inch baking sheets or pizza pans, a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, and a clean spray bottle.\n2. Place the flour and salt in a food processor and process for 10 seconds to mix thoroughly.\n3. With the motor running, add the water in a steady stream, then process for 10 seconds longer.\n4. The dough should have formed into one large ball; if not, feel the dough: If it feels very sticky, add 3 to 4 tablespoons more flour and process briefly until a ball forms.\n5. If the dough feels dry and floury, start the processor again, add 2 to 3 tabespoons more water, and process until a ball of dough forms.\n6. Once you have a ball of dough, process for 1 minute more, no longer.\n7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 30 seconds or so.\n8. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\n9. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, and place two racks near the center of the oven.\n10. Divide the dough into 8 pieces.\n11. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the other pieces covered.\n12. On a lightly floured surface, with lightly floured hands, flatten a piece of dough with your palms.\n13. Then roll it out to a very thin rectangle or round, as even a thinness as possible to ensure even cooking.\n14. Gently lift the dough from your rollling surface and place it on a large baking sheet or pizza pan.\n15. Sprinkle on one of the optional toppings or leave plain.\n16. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, cut through the dough to make rectangular crackers.\n17. (Don't worry if they are not all exactly the same size.\n18. Variations in size and flavor will make your crackers interesting.)\n19. Spray the dough lightly with water and place on the upper oven rack.\n20. Begin rolling out the next piece of dough, keeping an eye on the crackers already baking.\n21. (Crackers brown from underneath.)\n22. Check on them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after they go in.\n23. As soon as the thinnest patches of the dough have started to brown, take them out.\n24. If necessary, continue baking, checking every 30 seconds, but it is better to take the crackers out a little early than too late.\n25. You will soon get a feel for timing and degree of doneness.\n26. Variables that affect timing are the heat of your oven and how thin you managed to roll out your dough.\n27. When they come out of the oven, some of the crackers will be crisp, while others will need a little time in the air to crisp up.\n28. Transfer to a large bowl, breaking up any incompletely separated crackers.\n29. Roll out the remaining dough, season, and bake.\n30. When completely cool, crackers can be stored in a well-sealed plastic bag or cookie tins for up to a month.\n"}

Have ready four 8-ounce canning jars with 2-piece lids.\n2. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat so that the water is barely bubbling.\n3. Immerse the pint jars in the canning kettle.\n4. Place the rings and lids in a separate small saucepan and cover them with hot water.\n5. Leave the jars and lids immersed while you cook the jam.\n6. If you dont have a candy thermometer to tell you when the jam is done, place a small plate in the freezer.\n7. Combine the lemon slices, water, and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil and cook undisturbed until the lemon slices are translucent, about 20 minutes.\n8. Add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and the blueberries; cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and reaches 220F on a candy thermometer, 20 to 30 minutes.\n9. If you dont have a candy thermometer, remove the plate from the freezer and immediately spoon a teaspoon of jam onto it.\n10. Let it sit for a few minutes until the jam cools, then tilt the plate and see how much it runs.\n11. It will probably not wrinkle and get firm the way jams with more pectin would, but it should be thick and only slightly run.\n12. If its too runny, continue cooking it down, stirring frequently, until it thickens further.\n13. While the jam is still hot, ladle it into the hot, sterilized canning jars, leaving about 1/4 inch of head space at the top.\n14. Remove any air bubbles by running a long, nonmetallic utensil, such as a chopstick or wooden skewer, between the jar and the jam.\n15. Top with the prepared lids, close tightly, and process for 5 minutes in a hot-water bath with the jars submerged by at least 1 to 2 inches of water.\n16. Remove from the water and let cool, undisturbed, to room temperature.\n17. Besides making that telltale ping when it seals, the lid of a properly sealed jar should be slightly concave and not move; if the lid springs down and back when you press your finger in the center, the lid is unsealed.\n18. If it doesnt seal, process it again or store it in the refrigerator instead of at room temperature.\n19. Store sealed jars in a cool, dry place.\n"}

When you are making brewed tea, it is important to use a pot that has NOT had regular use for greasy foods, tomato sauces, or soups. I reserve a medium pot exclusively for boiling water for tea. Of course, I am fussy about my tea. Good tasting tea needs good tasting water in a clean pan. Use a good bottled water from a natural spring if it's a available. It does make a difference, and so does the tea your using. A quality organic tea, i.e. ,St Balfours or Infusions, makes a cup of tea over which you will want to linger. The bouquet and body of organic teas are superior to other commerical teas.\n2. While your tea is brewing, warm a teapot and/or the cups that you will be using. Fill them with hot water, and let them sit under a cotton kitchen towel until you are ready to serve the tea.\n3.

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: octopus, potatoes, onion\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Fair Style Octopus\nDirections:\n1. The meat of the fresh octopus is especially consistent, so if you are going to cook directly you must hit it with a kitchen mallet to soften it.\n2. For the laborious of this task, for a while now it is recommended to freeze and thaw it with time to prepare it, because the same effect is achieved in a comfortable and simple way.\n3. We are going to cook it in a large pot covered with boiling water, with two bay leaves and a small peeled onion.\n4. When the water is boiling, we introduce and gently remove the octopus in the pot 3 or 4 times to it.\n5. The proportion is that for each kilo of octopus it should be cooked for about half an hour, so for our octopus, 30 minutes of cooking will be enough.\n6. After a while we take out the octopus and, in the cooking water, we will throw the peeled and sliced potatoes to cook.\n7. This will impregnate the flavor and the intense color of the octopus.\n8. While the potatoes are cooking, we cut the octopus into slices with scissors.\n9. With the protagonists of the recipe already elaborated, we assemble our rations or tapas of octopus to the Galician.\n10. First we place a potato base and, on top of it, we put the octopus slices.\n11. Then sprinkle with sweet paprika and sprinkle with a good splash of extra virgin olive oil.\n"}

With your fingers and with a knife, carefully remove any white veins or connective tissue, without making too many holes liver. Sprinkle the inside of both parts with freshly ground black pepper before folding the to two halves back on top of each other.\n2. Pour the Cognac or Armagnac into a shallow bowl. Wet a large piece of cheesecloth completely, then wring it out and lay it on a flat surface. Place the liver on top of the cheesecloth, and then roll the cheesecloth tightly around the liver. You want it to resemble a log, so shape it with your hands as you roll. When you are happy with the shape, tuck the ends of the cheesecloth under.\n3. Inside the terrine, layer about 1 inch of sea salt. Place the cheesecloth package on top of the salt, and then cover it completely with the rest of the salt.

Wrap the top of the terrine in plastic, and place it in the refrigerator for 48 hours.

My Notes: I made this creme patisserie for some profiteroles I made and it was great:-) sweet, smooth and perfect consistency for use with pastry. I think next time I will substitute the vanilla essence for real bean extract tho for a little more flavour but it still tasted great. I will never buy custard again after making this.\n4. To me, The reason there are no cooking directions or explanations of to do after mixing ingredients is because it is a recipe that is to be used as an INGREDIENT for other recipes like cream puffs, eclairs, etc. I reached this recipe within a recipe for Chocolate Eclairs. Once I mix the Basic Choux Pastry Dough, I will go back to my Chocolate Eclair recipe and go from there -- that is where I will find an explanation for cooking and other directions. The same will go for Cream Puffs --\n5. I have made this vanilla cream many, many times but I add 2 more egg yolks and when it is almost ready to use I add 50 grms of butter. please taste it and enjoy.\n6. **Dad! I used this recipe for the filling of a Basque recipe. This is the cake that is famous in the Pays Basque area in France where my husband is from. Cornstarch not needed and I substituted the vanilla flavoring with almond flavoring. O.K.\n7. Grpa.July said it wasn't needed and I didn't want to use corn starch. I didn't use a thermometer but just stirred until the cream seemed really thick. I refrigerated for an hour. Perfect! I love this, I did however add a little more sugar, vanilla and kahlua. Wow amazing. next time I will try a little chocolate, just curious about how great it will taste. until next time, happy cooking. Rob --\n8. I made the recipe exactly as written and it is really good but when the cream was chilled it was so firm that I was able to stand a spoon upright in it. I too will leave out the corn starch the next time I make it. I much prefer a softer cream.I too,Play with my Food.\n"}

This recipe is by weight. For those who do not have a scale, sorry, I just can't get consistent results with measuring cups.\n2. Put Flour followed by salt and yeast in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Stir the ingredients to distribute yeast and salt in the flour. Add the Water.\n3. Mix on low for 12 minutes with a dough hook. If the dough does not come together completely in 2 minutes add more water a teaspoon at a time.\n4. Once mixed it will get a smooth texture but the dough will be too stressed to use the method to check that the gluten has bonded.\n5. Once mixed let rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours. this not only lets the yeast develop it also allows the dough to develop some of it's flavor.\n6. At least an hour before you want to bake the pizzas the dough needs to be portioned, and shaped into balls or disks. Also this is a good time to turn your oven onto full blast. The gluten in this flour too strong stretch into a pizza after shaping and it needs to rest for at least an hour before shaping. Dividing the dough in half will give 2 12-13 inch pizzas. Dividing it into 3 will give 3 8-9 inch pizzas.\n7. Add your favorite ingredients and bake on a pizza screen or on a pizza stone as hot as your oven will go. Watch closely as they bake quick 5-8 min.\n8. Quick tip: If you are baking on a pizza stone shape your pizza on parchment paper and transfer directly onto the stone.\n"}

In a large skillet, cook 6 ounces diced bacon over medium-high heat, stirring, until fat has rendered and bacon is browned and crisp, about 7 minutes. Lower heat if skillet gets too hot and begins to smoke.\n2. Stir in bread crumbs to evenly coat in bacon fat and cook, stirring and tossing, until bread crumbs are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer opened clams to a large bowl to cool, continuing to cover saute pan and checking frequently for newly opened clams. Continue until last clams have opened. (Some may open only a crack; this is fine, just pry the shell fully open.)\n5. Uncover saute pan and cook, stirring, until wine and clam liquid have evaporated and the shallot-bacon mixture has become jammy. Remove from heat and allow to cool.\n6. In a medium bowl, stir shallot-bacon mixture and 1/4 cup parsley into softened butter until thoroughly incorporated. Season lightly with salt and pepper. (Clams can be salty, so be careful not to over-season.)\n7. Working one at a time, pry off top shell of each clam and discard, making sure no shell fragments from hinge fall into clam. Free each clam from bottom shell, then set back in bottom shell and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.\n8. Using a butter knife, pack clam butter all around and over each clam, sealing each into the bottom shell. Sprinkle a small amount of bacon bread crumbs on top of each clam, pressing lightly to adhere. At this point, you can cover the baking sheet with plastic and refrigerate clams for up to 1 day before cooking. (You will have clam butter left over; keep it refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 1 week. It's delicious tossed with spaghetti for an easy weeknight meal.)\n9.

Coat a large bowl with butter and set aside.\n2. Place the milk and water in a small heatproof bowl or measuring cup and warm in the microwave until the mixture reaches 100 degrees F to 115 degrees F (this can also be done in a small saucepan on the stovetop over low heat).\n3. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top.\n4. Set aside until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes.\n5. Add the eggs, sugar, and salt and whisk until evenly combined.\n6. Add the measured flour and place the bowl on a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.\n7. Mix on low speed until the flour is incorporated and the dough just comes together, about 1 minute.\n8. Increase the speed to medium high and add the measured butter one piece at a time, letting each piece completely incorporate before adding the next.\n9. Continue mixing until the butter is completely incorporated and the dough is smooth and pulling away from the sides of the bowl (the dough will be soft, moist, and slightly sticky), about 10 minutes total.\n10. Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl and turn to coat with the butter.\n11. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and, if youre baking the sticky buns the same day, leave it in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 90 minutes.\n12. Punch the dough down, cover with plastic wrap, return to the warm place, and let rise again until doubled, about 45 to 60 minutes more.\n13. (If youre not baking the dough until the next day, place it in the refrigerator and let it rise overnight.)\n14. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle.\n15. Arrange the bacon slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until browned and crisp, about 15 to 25 minutes.\n16.

Set aside the remaining bacon fat.\n19. When the bacon slices are cool enough to handle, cut them into small dice and set aside.\n20. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.\n21. Add the brown sugar and whisk to combine.\n22. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the edges of the mixture start bubbling, about 4 minutes.\n23. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the cream, maple syrup, and salt.\n24. Divide the mixture between the prepared pans.\n25. Sprinkle half of the diced bacon into each pan; set the pans aside.\n26. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and keep the rack in the middle.\n27. Place a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil on a lower rack to catch any drips from the sticky buns while they are baking.\n28. (If you had let the dough rise overnight, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling out.)\n29. On a lightly floured work surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 14-by-14-inch square.\n30. Liberally brush the dough all the way to the edges with the reserved bacon fat.\n31. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and toasted pecans all the way to the edges.\n32. Starting at the edge closest to you, roll the dough into a cylindrical shape.\n33. As necessary, tuck the center in and under to ensure that the cylinder is being rolled to an even thickness.\n34. Using a sharp knife, slice the dough cylinder crosswise into 12 pieces (they will resemble slices of a tortilla wrap).\n35. Place 1 roll cut-side down in the center of each prepared cake pan.\n36. Evenly space 5 rolls around each center roll.\n37. Set the pans in a warm place uncovered and let the rolls rise until they touch the sides of the pan and each other, about 40 minutes.\n38. Place the pans in the oven on the middle rack and bake until the rolls are puffed and golden brown, about 35 minutes.\n39. Remove from the oven and allow the pans to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.\n40. Place a serving plate over top of each of the pans and invert the rolls onto the plate.\n41. Remove the pans.\n42.

Makes approximately 24 regular sized cupcakes. Follow recipe to a T!\n2. *Tip: It is best if you mise en place (measure out) everything before you begin. Since this recipe needs to be done pretty exactly as stated, it will help your baking go a lot more smoothly.\n3. 1. Preheat oven to 325 F. Line two 12 cup cupcake tins with liners and set aside.\n4. 2. Next, let's brown the butter:\n5. -In a small saucepan, add your 1/2 cup of butter. Over medium heat, melt the butter.\n6. -Once butter is all the way melted it will boil and froth. At this point, watch carefully, things will move quickly now.\n7. -Once the bubbles die down and leave only froth, you will start to smell a nutty scent! Almost there!\n8. -Swirl pan around. You should see a light golden brown color and a notice a very nutty smell. Once that happens cook another 5-10 seconds and remove pan from heat. Pour into a bowl to cool (and stop the cooking).\n9. 3. In a small sauce pot, add your milk and vanilla extract. Gently warm over medium low heat until just warmed. You want the temperature to be a little warmer than your body temperature. So dip that finger in. If it's slightly warm to the touch, you're perfect! Turn off the heat and set aside.\n10. 4. In a bowl whisk together your flour, cocoa powder and salt until totally combined. Set aside.\n11. 5. For this recipe we will need to make a small amount of fresh coffee. Make a cup and set aside 2 tablespoons.\n12. 6. In a clean and dry stand or hand held mixer bowl, beat your egg whites. You will want to make sure you have stiff peaks. Set aside.\n13. 7. In another clean bowl, beat your eggs yolks and powdered sugar on low speed. Once mixed in, scrape down bowl, turn up speed and beat until light and fluffy. Add your cooled, browned butter. Mix again thoroughly.\n14. 8. Mix together your milk/vanilla mixture with your coffee. With mixer on low, alternate adding your flour/cocoa mix and milk/coffee mix into your yolks, 1/2 at a time. Stop and scrape bowl between add ins. Yes, your mixture should be VERY liquidy. Like hot chocolate consistency. You're OK. Keep going.\n15. 9. Next, add your egg whites into your batter. Gently fold/whip/cut your whites into the batter until it is almost completely mixed in. Little egg white clumps are OK but just make sure to break up any large chunks.\n16. 10. Carefully pour your batter into your cupcake liners. You can go ahead and fill almost all the way up. I did 3/4 of the way. These cakes will rise only slightly. My batter yielded 23 cupcakes, but if I had poured a tiny less in I would have gotten 24.\n17. 11. Bake for 15-20 minutes turning the pans half way through your timing. You are wanting your cakes to be puffed and cracked slightly, and still barely jiggling in the very center. Remove from oven, set pans on racks and let them cool completely!\n18. If you're making a day ahead, just refrigerate overnight. Once cooled, plate up and dust with a generous portion of powdered sugar.\n19. Notes:\n20. -Can be made a day or two ahead. Just refrigerate in an airtight container.\n21. -Keep leftovers stored in a airtight container in the fridge.\n22. Recipe adapted from White on Rice Couple.\n"}

Gather all your ingredients and roast the nuts. You can dry roast them or roast them in ghee ( which I have omitted for my lightened up version. Cashews are best roasted in ghee whereas almonds are just as good dry roasted.\n2. Add a tablespoon of ghee to a pan on medium heat. Once it melts and heats up add the rava . There should be enough ghee to coat the rava to make it resemble wet sand.\n3. Start boiling the water simultaneously on another stove or the microwave. Take 2 cups of water before boiling . It is alright if it reduces a bit while boiling. I have taken that into account.\n4. Keep stirring often to roast the rava and do not let it burn. Reduce the heat if you have to. The rava is done when it turns a pinkish shade\n5. At that point add another 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of ghee and add the coconut and dates and the cardamom pods. Roast all the ingredients for another 2-3 minutes . Keep stirring often to ensure all the ingredients are evenly roasted but at the same time not burning.\n6. Add the boiling water and quickly stir to get a liquid mixture . Make sure there are no lumps. If there are any, try to break it up by beating it through the center. The rava will absorb the water quickly so you have to work fast . Reduce the heat a bit more if needed.\n7. As soon as you have a smooth mixture, add the brown sugar and saffron and stir quickly to get another smooth mixture.\n8. At this point stir a few times to ensure that the mixture is evenly cooked . When the water has almost been completely absorbed, switch off the heat. Let it sit for a minute and then remove the halwa from the pan.\n9. You can serve it in small cups or ramekins or press it flat in a baking pan to cut into pieces for serving.\n10. * I used light brown sugar for this recipe. You can use white sugar or turbinado sugar . I don't think dark brown sugar will work for this recipe. But let me know if it does. In India, the sugar you get is in the form of crystals similar to sugar in the raw.\n"}

Add in water and pulse until combined into a dough.\n5. (You may have to add a little more water but dont add too much.\n6. You dont want to the dough to be too wet.)\n7. Divide dough into 2 pieces, and wrap each in wax paper.\n8. Chill for at least 30 minutes.\n9. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll the dough out on the wax paper until its about 1/8 inch thick.\n10. Using a ruler and a pastry or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 1-inch squares (the ruler helps ensure that all crackers are the same size).\n11. Use a toothpick or skewer to punch a hole in the middle of the square.\n12. In addition to making it look like an authentic Cheez It, this also keeps the cracker from puffing up too much.\n13. Separate the squares and transfer to a baking sheet.\n14. You can put the crackers pretty close to each other as they dont spread very much during baking.\n15. Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.\n16. The more color they have, the more they will taste like a true Cheez It.\n17. Cool completely.\n18. The recipe makes about 100 crackers.\n19. (Recipe adapted from In Katrinas Kitchen.)\n"}

In a small pot, whisk the glutinous rice flour and water over medium heat until it forms a sticky goo. This will take a couple minutes but make sure to keep whisking or else it will burn. Once it forms the blob, take it off the heat to cool.\n2. In the bowl of stand mixer, combine the bread flour, ube powder, egg whites, sugar, yeast, salt, and the sticky blob of glutinous rice flour.\n3. Mix on low first until everything is combined. It will look a little dry at first, but just keep mixing. Try to refrain from adding water because it will throw off the ratio of ingredients. You will have to scrape the bowl a couple times.\n4. Once everything has come together, mix on medium/high for 5 minutes. Then add the butter and mix on high for another 15-20 minutes. The dough will look more like a paste and stick to the sides of the bowl. If you run your spatula around the sides and the dough sticks like crazy, you will need to add more bread flour. The dough should still sort of hold its shape, but it will look like a goo when kneading.\n5. Make sure to knead for the entire 15-20 minutes. Then cover the bowl with a damp paper towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 2 hours).\n6. On a floured surface, form the dough into a rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick, and one that when you roll up will fit in your loaf tin.\n7. Line your loaf tin with parchment paper so that there are long portions of the paper hanging from two sides. Place your formed bread in and cover lightly with the hanging parchment paper and some plastic wrap.\n8. Place in the fridge to proof for 12-18 hours. I do this overnight. The next day it should look slightly more poofy.\n9. Take the bread out to room temperature while you preheat your oven to 330 degrees F.\n10. Bake the bread cover with the parchment paper for 25 minutes then uncover and bake for another 20 minutes. The bread should sound hollow when you tap it and be golden brown.\n11. Take the bread out of the loaf tin by lifting the parchment paper. Let cool on a wire rack.\n"}

Using the dough hook, gradually add in the flour mixture, mixing on medium-low.\n6. Mix well between each addition and scrape down the sides of the bowl so the flour is incorporated into the dough (I add the flour in 4 portions).\n7. Mix until the dough comes together - It doesn't have to form one single ball, but it does need to come together, and most of the dough should have come off the sides of the mixing bowl.\n8. If the dough still seems too crumbly and not cohesive enough, add water 1/2 teaspoon at a time and beat on medium for one minute until the dough comes together.\n9. I RARELY, if ever, have to add more than 1/2 teaspoon of water.\n10. I usually don't add any water at all.\n11.

Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie sheet, place the straws on the parchment with 1/2 of space between them.\n13.

The cheese straws should be barely beginning to brown when you remove them from the oven.\n17. Let the straws cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then place the straws on a rack to cool.\n18. If you try to put the straws on a cooling rack immediately after you take them out of the oven, they may break while you're trying to transfer them from the sheet to the rack.\n19.

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: sugar, after, lemons, unsalted butter\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Strawberry Jam For Henry\nDirections:\n1. Prepare you jars if you are canning - make sure they are clean and sterile and ready. Put 2 spoons in the freezer.\n2. Put the strawberries, lemon juice and reisling in a large heavy pot and bring to a boil. At the same time whisk the pectin and the sugar together. Once the strawberries have come to a boil add the remaining ingredients and stir together thoroughly. Bring it back to a boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer. Simmer until the strawberries are soft - this should just take a few minutes. The whole idea behind a pectin jam is that you don't have to cook the fruit as long which makes for a nice fresh tasting jam.\n3. Once the strawberries are soft, gently run through your jam with a potato masher and break them up a bit - leave some large chunks too. Get a spoon out of the freezer and dribble a bit of the jam on the back. Run your finger through it. If the track stays clear you are done, if not simmer a few more minutes and re-test.\n4. Turn off the heat. Some people say skim the foam, but I just stir the jam down so there isn't any. The butter helps also.\n5. If you are canning - fill your jars, clean the rims, secure the lids and rings, and re-boil for 10 minutes. Remove from the canning pot and let rest until completely cool - at least 12-14 hours. Check your seals and store in a cool dark place. Share with friends and neighbors!\n"}

Add all of the ingredients except for the oil into a food mill and mix.\n2. If you don't have a food mill please refer to Step 9.\n3. If that's the case please add the oil in a little bit at a time here.\n4. Add the oil in 3 separate batches, mixing for 10 seconds each time.\n5. When you add the oil for the last time, mix until all the lumps are gone.\n6. Stop the mixing a few times and shake the contents around then keep mixing.\n7. You will have a really runny mayonnaise, so put the mayo in a plastic bag, cut a small corner off the bag and squeeze the mayo into an empty mayonnaise bottle.\n8. If you use a Matsuda mayonnaise bottle, the lid will come off really easily so it's easy to clean and put stuff into.\n9. I've been trying to produce less items to wash when cooking, so I've been measuring out 165 g of oil directly on the scales.\n10. I like to use pressed canola oil or corn oil.\n11.

If you're using a food mill you shouldn't have any problems but if you're having problems mixing everything manually please refer to Step 8.\n14. If you've mucked up the mayo, place it in the fridge overnight.\n15. Once it's separated, add 1 tablespoon of shop-bought mayo, or completed homemade mayo and blend it again.\n16. Lots of people tried this recipe by using whisks, hand mixers, and food processors.\n17. Some even shook the ingredients together in a container.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: yellow onion, beans, olive oil, sage, salt, truffle oil, water\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Ingredient Tuscan Bean Soup\nDirections:\n1. Soak beans overnight, or for at least 6 hours. In a pinch, soaking can be skipped, you'll just have to simmer the beans for longer until they're fully cooked. I think this is a perfectly acceptable alternative.\n2. Trim the ends off the onion and remove the skin, but leave it whole. In a stock pot, at least a gallon in size, add 3 quarts of water, beans, the whole onion, fresh sage, oil, and salt. The amount of oil can be adjusted depending on the size of your pot, but the idea is to entirely cover the top surface of the water, and it's ok if some sage is sticking up through the oil The flavorful oils from the sage should end up infusing the oil and mixing beautifully into the finished soup, so reduce if you must, but don't exclude the olive oil. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer lightly until beans are cooked through, at least an hour.\n3. When the beans are fully cooked, fish out the sage and the onion with a slotted spoon, and discard. Then, spoon out about half of the beans and set them aside in a bowl. (If you like a smoother soup, take out fewer beans, 1/4 - 1/2 is a good amount to leave whole). Puree the beans and broth that remain in the pot with an immersion blender until smooth. Add the reserved, whole beans back in. Adjust salt to your liking, add pepper if desired.\n4. Ladle into a bowl, and drizzle with a little bit of truffle oil, about 1 Tablespoon per bowl, enough to make an attractive spiral. The flavor of truffle oil goes a long way with only a small amount. If you have extra sage, it makes a pretty garnish. Sometimes, I'll fry a few of the extra leaves in hot vegetable oil for about twenty seconds to make a crispy, delicious, classy looking garnish, but the truffle oil alone is pretty enough. Enjoy!\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: dough, milk, yeast, flour, unsalted butter, sugar, egg yolk, salt, filling, chocolate chips\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Five-Spice Chocolate Sweet Rolls\nDirections:\n1. To make the dough, heat the milk until just lukewarm. Stir in the yeast and let sit for 5-10 minutes.\n2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, or by hand in a large bowl, mix together the milk/yeast mixture, flour, butter, sugar, egg yolk, and salt. Mix until the dough comes together, and then knead until the dough is very smooth and elastic-don't skimp on this step. It should take about 10 minutes in a stand mixer. If the dough is still pretty sticky, carry on kneading until it feels quite smooth.\n3. Lightly grease a large bowl and place the dough in it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rise for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until puffy and almost doubled.\n4. Gently press down the dough to deflate it, and turn it out onto a counter. The dough is buttery enough that you shouldn't need extra flour-it shouldn't stick.\n5. Press/roll/stretch the dough out into a large rectangle, about 12 x 18 in size.\n6. Brush the melted butter evenly over the dough, leaving a little space around all the edges (about 1/2 Whisk the five-spice powder into the sugar to combine, then sprinkle the mixture evenly over the butter. Sprinkle the chocolate evenly over the surface.\n7. Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll the rectangle into a long log. Pinch the seam closed firmly. Using a serrated knife or a piece of unflavored dental floss, slice the dough into 2-inch rounds (or a little thinner).\n8. Place the rolls into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. (I like to grease the pan, then line it with parchment, and then grease it again because then the rolls pop out easily.) Cover the pan with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rise until puffy, about 20 minutes. Towards the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 375 F.\n9. Bake the rolls for about 25 minutes (start checking after 20, and then may take as long as 30 -- just take them out when they are golden brown on top). Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 15 minutes.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: sugar, milk, kosher salt, heavy cream, basil, egg yolks\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Berry Basil Ice Cream\nDirections:\n1. Puree all the berries with 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a blender. When liquified, pour through a strainer into a bowl and reserve. (I suppose you don't need to strain it if you want a more rustic ice cream with seeds in it, but even as I pushed it through a mesh sieve, some seeds still managed to get through!)\n2. In a medium sauce pan, mix the milk, pinch of salt, remaining 3/4 cup sugar, and 1 cup of the cream. Warm the cream mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves and small bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan (about 3 or 4 minutes.) Stir in the torn basil leaves, cover and remove from heat. Let this sit at least an hour or two. Taste it and if you would like a stronger basil flavor, simply let it sit longer. (Mine sat for 2 hours.)\n3. Prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with several inches of ice water. Set a metal bowl that will hold 1 1/2 quarts in the center of the ice water. Pour the remaining 1 cup of cream into the inner bowl to start it chilling, which will help the rest of the mixture cool faster when you pour it in later. Have a fine strainer ready. Whisk the egg yolks.\n4. Take the basil out of the cream mixture and rewarm for about 2-3 minutes. In a steady stream, pour half the warm cream into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so the eggs don't cook. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pan with a heatproof rubber spatula. The custard should be thick enough to coat the back of the spatula and a line should form when you draw your finger through it. This should take about 6-8 minutes. Be sure not to overheat the custard or let it come to a boil or it will separate and curdle. Immediately strain the custard into the cold cream in the ice bath. Cool the custard to 70 by stirring it in the ice bath. When cooled, stir in the berry puree.\n5. Refrigerate the custard until chilled, about 4 hours. Then freeze the custard in your ice cream maker according to your manufacturer's instructions. Store in an airtight container and freeze for about 4 hours. The ice cream will keep up to 2 weeks in your freezer.\n6. Makes about 1 quart.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: cream cheese, powdered sugar, eggs, yogurt, liqueur, vanilla, like\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Basic Cheesecake Filling Recipe\nDirections:\n1. Here's where it gets fun.\n2. The more cream cheese you use, the denser the cheesecake will be (but not dry!)\n3. The more Large eggs you use, the fluffier it will be.\n4. There's a delicate balance here - 1 lb cheese and 3 Large eggs will give you a fluffy cheesecake, but if you use 2 lbs cheese, 3 Large eggs is an absolute must if you do not want it to be flat.\n5. More Large eggs than 3, and you'll taste the Large eggs.\n6. 1 lb cheese and 2 Large eggs is a nice balance, too, but going any lower than which you'll just end up with something flat.\n7. The powdered sugar works best for two reasons - number one, powdered sugar contains corn starch, that acts as a thickener, and number two, you do not have to worry about the grittiness of undissolved sugar in your cake.\n8. The yogurt or possibly lowfat sour cream adds moistness and a little bit of tang to the cake.\n9. It's not necessary, but it adds oomph to either a bland cake or possibly a citrus-flavored cake.\n10. For liqueur, add in no more than 1/2 c. if you're using the yogurt or possibly lowfat sour cream, and make sure you're using the three Large eggs.\n11. If you eliminate the yogurt/lowfat sour cream, you can increase the liqueur to 3/4 c., and 2 Large eggs will work (but three is still better - two works best only if you're not using the yogurt/lowfat sour cream )and( your liqueur is only 1/2 c..) A fruit or possibly vegetable puree should be relatively dry - drain off the liquid in a sieve, or possibly put it in a saucepan, fold in some cornstarch, and heat it till it's thick.\n12. You can use an entire c. of puree if you eliminate the yogurt/lowfat sour cream.\n13. Either fold in the puree with the batter, or possibly reserve a c. or possibly so of batter, mix it with the puree, then swirl it into the cheesecake.\n14. The vanilla is a must, in my opinion.\n15. Lots of times, I'll throw in an extra tsp.\n16. for good measure.\n17. Other extracts can enhance the flavor - banana extract in a strawberry cheesecake, coconut extract or possibly almond extract in an Amaretto cheesecake, etc.\n18. Another addition would be cocoa or possibly chocolate.\n19. Cocoa mixes in nicely without making the cheesecake gooey - 4-6 Tbsp will do it.\n20. Melted chocolate or possibly white chocolate chips should not really exceed 6 ounce, even 4 ounce will usually do sufficient for the flavor.\n21. If you're doing the swirl thing, use only 2-3 ounce melted chocolate for the batter which's being swirled in.\n22. Make sure the melted stuff is cooled before you mix it in.\n23.

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: flour, salt, water, extra virgin olive oil\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Egg Free Noodles\nDirections:\n1. In a clean plastic bowl combine dry ingredients and wisk them together till combined (about five minutes.).\n2. Microwave a cup of water for about a minute or two. Add half of the water to the dry mix and knead with your hands for three minutes.\n3. Add your olive oil and knead for another three minutes.\n4. At this point you should have a moist lump of dough in the shape of a big ball. If need be add some more water if it is not coming together or it seems too dense.\n5. Pinch a small amount off of the ball and taste. Adjust flavor with dry spices etc and knead for five minutes. If taste is to likeing continue or repeat. If dough is too dry add a bit more water and knead for a few minutes.\n6. Divide the dough ball into two portions and knead each portion for another three minutes, then form each into a ball. Place the smaller dough balls into containers and put in the fridge till they cool. Once cool take the containers out and cover them and put them back into the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes.\n7. If you are making and cooking your pasta for now set your large pot of fresh water with a bit of salt on the stove. If you are saving the dough for another day try to keep the air away from it and keep it moist or frozen.\n8. To make the dough into pasta remove a ball from the fridge and begin to knead by hand for a good 15 to 20 minutes. The better you knead the dough to more consistent your pasta will be.\n9. Take the plastic bowl and clean and dry it while the dough has been proofing and sprinkle it with flour. Sprinkle the rolling area with a good amount of flour prior to rolling out your dough (be it the table, a pasta machine, whatever.).\n10. Divide the small ball into four equal chunks.\n11. If you are rolling by hand flour your rolling pin or hands and roll out the dough to a thinkness you like and cut to size. Place cut pasta over the floured bowl to air dry for a few minutes. Always air dry the pasta for a good five minutes prior to cooking or it will turn mushy.\n12. If you are useing a pasta machine take the chunk and make it into a small oblong ball. Set the pasta machine to it's thickest and crank out the dough. Set it to each increment smaller till you get the thickness you want making sure you flour the machine between sizeing the pasta to keep it from clumping in the machine. Use the ribbon attatchments on the pasta sheet for whatever size pasta you want or just hand cut to size. Air dry your pasta for a few minutes by placing it over the floured bowl.\n13. Hopefully you began boiling your water in between batches of dough and by the time you are almost through your second dough chunk you should be able to cook some pasta. Slotted spoon in hand place some of your newly minted pasta into the boiling water and watch it. If it is falling apart you need to let it dry some more or add some extra flour to the outside of the pasta. Depending on the size of your noodle it may be done in as little as one to two minutes. Remove a test noodle and let it cool for a few seconds and taste (don't be afraid to have made some herbed butter or have your favorite sauce ready to test the flavor combinations.) If all is right you can crank out as much pasta as you want to and get cooking.\n14. Note: Only cook the fresh pasta in small batches as it tends to clump too much in larger batches. If you are feeling adventurous try making your own ravioli with your own stuffing inside. You can also make thicker style pasta (rustic if you want to give it a cool name) by keeping the pasta sheets thicker and tearing or pinching off portions of the pasta. Toss these bigger chunks in seasoned flour and cook em up. I once did this and fried em on my side burner of my grill to go with the steaks I was grilling. Needless to say that was a great night.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: water, sugar, lemons, vanilla beans, pears, chocolate, chocolate sauce, heavy cream, milk, egg yolks, bittersweet chocolate, unsalted butter\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Poire Belle Helene\nDirections:\n1. For the Pears: Pour the water, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice into a non-reactive 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat.\n2. Using a sharp knife, slice the vanilla beans in half lengthwise.\n3. Separate the seeds from the skins by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside.\n4. Add the seeds and skins to the mixture and continue heating.\n5. Peel and core the pears but do not halve them.\n6. Coring the pears from the bottom will encourage the poaching liquid to seep inside the pear and help it cook evenly inside and out.\n7. Add the pears to the lemon mixture and bring to a boil.\n8. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook for about 1 hour.\n9. Do not overcook the pears; they should be soft enough to pierce easily with a wooden skewer or toothpick.\n10. In order to keep the pears immersed in the liquid and help them to poach evenly, you must make a parchment paper lid to cover them.\n11. To make the lid, cut a round disk from a sheet of parchment paper that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your pan.\n12. Place the paper lid directly on top of the pears and poaching liquid.\n13. When the pears are fully poached, pour them and the poaching liquid into a clean container.\n14. The pears can stay in the poaching liquid for up to 3 days, each day they will become more flavorful and colorful.\n15. A few hours before serving, remove the pears from the liquid and drain them on a wire rack placed over a parchment paper-covered sheet pan.\n16. You will need 1 whole pear for each serving.\n17. To assemble the Poire Belle Helene, place a scoop of chocolate ice cream at the bottom use a sundae glass.\n18. Drizzle the chocolate sauce over the ice cream then place a pear on top.\n19. Drizzle more chocolate sauce on top of the pear, and top it with whipped cream and another drizzle of sauce.\n20. For the Chocolate Ice Cream: Heat the milk and chopped chocolate together in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan (this will keep the milk from burning) over medium-high heat until bubbles form around the edge of the pan.\n21. While the milk is heating, combine the sugar and egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly incorporated and thick.\n22. Temper the egg mixture by pouring about half of the hot milk into it and whisk well.\n23. Now pour the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk and chocolate.\n24. Cook over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula.\n25. The mixture has finished cooking when it is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n26. Use the following method to tell if it is finished: Quickly dip the spatula into the hot mixture and hold it horizontally in front of you.\n27. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula.\n28. If the mixture holds and does not fill in the line, it is ready to be removed from the heat.\n29. If the line fills with liquid, the mixture must be cooked a little longer.\n30. Repeat the test every 30 seconds until ready.\n31. At no time should the mixture begin to boil.\n32. If you see bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan, remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture thoroughly to cool it down.\n33. Once the mixture has finished cooking, pour it into a clean bowl and set aside to cool.\n34. If you want to reduce the cooling time, you can cool the chocolate ice cream base over an ice bath.\n35. When the mixture is cool, spin it according to the type of ice cream machine you are using.\n36. The ice cream is ready when it is creamy and smooth, like the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.\n37. Place the ice cream in an airtight container and store in the freezer until ready to use.\n38. For the Chocolate Sauce: Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil.\n39. When it boils, remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate.\n40. Whisk well, stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine.\n41. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth.\n42. Set the ganache aside.\n43. In a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, and sugar.\n44. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.\n45. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved.\n46. Once the mixture has come to a boil, pour the cream into the warm ganache.\n47. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk.\n48. As the chocolate sauce cooks, it will begin to thicken slightly.\n49. When it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and pour it into a clean, dry bowl.\n50. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming.\n51. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator.\n52. When cold, the chocolate sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon.\n53. This sauce can be reheated whenever needed.\n54. If using a microwave, simply place the chocolate sauce in a microwaveable bowl and heat it at medium-high power in 30-second intervals until it becomes liquid.\n55. On the stovetop, place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and stir occasionally until it becomes liquid.\n56. If you store it in a squeeze bottle, you can easily drizzle it over a dessert or decorate a plate.\n57. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.\n58. It can also be frozen for up to 2 months if stored in an airtight container.\n59. Thaw in the refrigerator and heat as described above until liquid.\n"}

Put the yeast, water, and milk in the bowl of a stand mixer and, using a wooden spoon, stir until the yeast is dissolved. Add the flour and salt, and fit the mixer with the dough hook, if you have one. Toss a kitchen towel over the mixer, covering the bowl as completely as you can to keep you from being covered in flour! Turn the mixer on and off in a few short pulses, just to dampen the flour (you can peek), then remove the towel, increase mixer speed to medium-low and mix for a minute or two. At this point you will have a dry, shaggy mess.\n2. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula, set the mixer to low and add the eggs, followed by the sugar. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about 3 minutes, until the dough forms a ball. Reduce speed to low and add the butter in 2 Tablespoon size chunks, beating until each piece is almost incorporated before adding the next. You'll have a dough that is very soft, almost like a batter. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes.\n3. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, 40-60 minutes. Deflate the dough by lifting it up around the edges and letting it fall with a slap into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. Slap the dough down in the bowl every 30 minutes until it stops rising, about 2 hours, then leave the covered dough in the refrigerator overnight.\n4. If making Brioche loaves: Butter and flour 2 8.5 X 4.5 inch loaf pans. Pull dough from the fridge and divide into two equal pieces. Cut each piece of dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a log about 3.5 inches long. Arrange 4 logs crosswise in the bottom of each pan. Put the pans on a baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat, cover the pans lightly with wax paper and leave the loaves at room temperature until dough fills pans.\n5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake until loaves are well risen and deeply golden, about 30-35 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes, then run a knife around the sides of the pans and turn the loaves out onto cooling racks. Cool at least one hour.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: blueberries, vodka, basil\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: Blueberry Basil Infused Vodka\nDirections:\n1. Give blueberries a good rinse, then add to a large pot (no need to dry them). Warm blueberries over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cook blueberries until they release a decent amount of liquid. You can eyeball this step. I stopped cooking the blueberries once more liquid was visible than solid berries. Cooking the berries this way speeds up infusing times. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.\n2. Add blueberries with juices to a large, airtight jar. Pour in vodka. Seal the jar and store in a cool, dark spot.\n3. Each day, give the jar a little shake, then taste the vodka. As the days go on, you'll notice that the blueberry flavor will get stronger. I was pleased with the flavor after 6 days of infusing; however, this can vary based on taste. Once you are satisfied with the blueberry flavor, stir in the basil leaves.\n4. Seal the jar once again and store in a cool, dark spot. After 24 hours, pour the mixture through a fine-mesh basket strainer into a clean bowl or jar. Discard the solids.\n5. The more solid matter that you strain from the vodka, the longer the alcohol will last. I find that I use up my infusions several weeks after making them, so I'm fine with a single strain. If you are planning on keeping this infusion for an extended period of time, line the strainer with several layers of cheesecloth, and strain again.\n"}

The day before you want to make the caneles, combine the milk, cream, butter, and 1/4 cup (50 g) of the sugar in a medium saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.\n2. Meanwhile, in a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup (198 g) sugar and the flour to combine. When the milk is about to simmer, add the eggs, yolks, rum, and vanilla to the bowl (with the sugar/flour mixture) and whisk to combine.\n3. Pour the hot milk mixture into the bowl in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until the batter is smooth; take care not to incorporate too much air.\n4. Strain the batter into a storage container, cover tightly, and refrigerate overnight or for up to 24 hours.\n5. The next day, set the batter out to warm to room temperature for 1 hour-you can work with it in batches if necessary. (I only have one mold with 8 cavities, so I make two batches.)\n6. Preheat the oven to 450 F with the oven rack in the center. Rub the cavities of a silicone canele mold generously with soft butter. Place the mold on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 3-4 minutes. Meanwhile, transfer the batter to a container with a spout, such as a large liquid measure.\n7. When the mold (on the baking sheet) is hot, pour the batter into the molds, filling each three-quarters full (my mold has 8 cavities that each hold 1/3 cup (about 75 g) batter. If your molds are larger/smaller you may need more/less). Immediately return the mold and baking sheet to the oven and bake until the caneles puff up and begin to brown, 30-32 minutes. (Resist the urge to open the oven door during baking other than the following steps-the pastries are more likely to bake properly with a consistent oven temperature!)\n8. Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and bake the caneles for 30-32 minutes more; the surface should be very golden.\n9. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a small offset spatula to loosen each pastry gently from the mold and flip it over inside the mold (this will help brown the pastries evenly all over). Return the caneles to the oven and bake until the tops are deeply golden, 12-15 minutes more.\n10. Let the caneles cool completely in the mold before unmolding and serving.\n"}

Turn the heat up to about medium high.\n9. Let soup get to a high simmer or low boil and then add the barley. The barley will absorb water and become larger as it cooks, so don't be tempted to bump up the amount too much. It should also give the stock a more silky, slightly thickened texture. Watch it, you may have to turn down the heat so the barley doesn't cause the pot to boil over.\n10. Let the barley cook in the soup for about 30-40 minutes or until tender.\n11.

In a stand mixer you should start from a low speed and work your way up for at least 3 or 4 minutes until your dough has a Play-doh feel to it.\n3. If its too wet sprinkle in a bit of flour or if its too dry and breaking apart add a teaspoon of your egg whites and continue working it.\n4. Form your dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for an hour.\n5. After it has rested unwrap it and flour it and your work surface well.\n6. Start rolling with your rolling pin and once your dough is flat and thin fold the edges inside and fold again (see related blog link for step-by-step photos).\n7. Turn your dough around and start rolling again towards the shorter sides.\n8. Cut your dough in half when its too long too handle and roll again.\n9. Repeat one more time with both halves of the dough.\n10. At the end you should have four individual sheets to work with.\n11. Work one sheet at the time until its really thin and about 16 inches (40cm) long.\n12. Dont panic if the dough pulls back a lot, just keep rolling.\n13. When your sheets are nice and thin its time to give the fettuccine shape to your pasta.\n14. Fold your sheet four times carefully applying flour so it wont stick.\n15. Then with a sharp knife cut into thin strips about half and inch (1cm) each.\n16. Carefully unfold each strip and arrange into a nest while flouring so the fettuccine wont stick together.\n17. Repeat until all the noodles are cut.\n18. Boil in a pot of salted water for 2 1/2 minutes, then drain and serve immediately with sauce of your choosing.\n"}

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.\n2. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.\n3. Slice beets on thinnest setting using a mandolin. This gives you paper thin wafers that are relatively consistent in thickness. TIP: Use a glass or non-porous cutting board/mat. Beets stain surfaces! You can use red or yellow beets, or a mixture.\n4. Place sliced beets in a glass bowl and toss with EVOO and salt. Allow to sit for 20 minutes. This process (salt) draws excess moisture from the beets. Once 20 min have passed toss beets in their liquid and drain.\n5. Place slices in a single layer on parchment lined baking sheets. Sprinkle with a bit of sugar, this brings sweetness back out. Sprinkle with rosemary powder.\n6. Bake 30-50 minutes. Until crisp. Remove from oven and allow to cool.\n7. Place in air tight container with a silica packet. If you do not have some silica packets laying around (they come in jerky packages, etc.) make a small rice sock. This process keeps the chips crisp while in container rather than the chips absorbing the moisture from the air the rice/ silica do.\n"}

{"text": "User:\nGenerate a recipe (title + steps) using the given ingredients.\nIngredients: egg, water, food coloring, vinegar\n\nAssistant:\nTitle: An Easter Egg\nDirections:\n1. I will start out with a few tips that I know from my grandmother that are good to know when doing this. First, it is best to color the eggs while they are still warm. The water in which the egg is dipped to be colored should also be quite warm and a tablespoon of vinegar is added to each container holding a color. Both of these help to achieve brighter and more saturated colors ( but needless to say the quality of the food coloring is important). When doing this, it usually requires that you boil between 15-20 eggs. That is to ensure that there is an egg for everyone who stops by as well as to compensate for some that might crack while boiling. Follow the usual procedure for boilng them ( bring them to room temperature, cover with cold water, put on the stove...), but my grandmother also puts a kitchen towel on the bottom of the pot and folds it in between the eggs in the water. When you go to remove the eggs from the water, do so one by one in between the folds.\n2. You will also need to hunt down a lady's stocking or a pantyhose for this, the thinner the better. Cut a straight tube from it between 5-7 inches, depending on how stretchy it is, and tie a knot on one end. Prepare a few more like this and set them aside.\n3. Assuming your eggs are boiled at this point, dissolve the colors in very warm water to be ready for dipping. I used several sour cream containers. Add the vinegar to the water along with the colors. Holding an egg in a dish towel, draw whatever design you like on it with a thin pencil. Redraw over the pencil line with the crayon. It is good if the crayon melts some while doing this. That will ensure it will fill the egg pores and won't allow the coloring to work there. If too much seems to remain on the egg surface, you can carefully scrape it off with the blade of a small knife. I prefer a neutral crayon, but you can use a color one if you like.\n4. Place the egg in the prepared tied stocking, and tie a knot at the other end. Make the egg as tight inside as you can without breaking it, to ensure that it won't move around. This is easier to do if someone holds the knot at the bottom for you.\n5. The next important thing is to think about the order in which you choose what colors to dip in. The variation is achieved by the overlapping of several colors. I first dipped the egg in the yellow about 3/4 of the way and let it sit for about 5 min. Then took it out and placed it in a slot in the empty egg carton to sit for another 5 min. Then carefully untied the top knot ( or just cut it off ), and take the egg out and let the yellow dry out. Place the dried egg in a clean sock and tie again as above. Dip the egg about 1/2 of the way into the blue color, but with the other side of the egg going in first. Hold it in another 5 min, let sit outside another 5 min, take it out of the sock and leave it in a clean slot on the carton to dry. For the last color (red) I just held the egg in the liquid with my hand as it only needed to be dipped abou 1/3 of the way.Then let it dry in the egg carton, placing it with the wet part downward, or your color will run down the side. At the top where the yellow didn't go, the egg was a turquoise blue. Below it where the blue and the yellow overlapped, it turned light green. Below it a band of yellow remained. And at the bottow the red and yellow combined to make an orange circle. This particular egg happened to have a sort of a defect on its shell ( calcium concentration I think) and I used it as a center to my flower design. After it was all done and dried, we found some children's stickers and I used the outside of a butterfly sticker and placed it there. I used a brown egg for this. If you have white ones, I assume there will be even more contrast between the colors.\n"}
